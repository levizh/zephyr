  HC32 DMA controller

  a phandle to the DMA controller plus the following four integer cells:
    1. channel: the dma channel from 0 to <dma-requests>
    2. slot: DMA triger source, which is the event source number
       this value please ref UM INTC chapter
    3. channel-config: A 32bit mask specifying the DMA channel configuration
    which is device dependent:
        -bit 6-7 : Direction  (see dma.h)
               0x0: MEM to MEM
               0x1: MEM to PERIPH
               0x2: PERIPH to MEM
               0x3: reserved for PERIPH to PERIPH
        -bit 9 : Source Increment Address
               0x0: no address increment between transfers
               0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 10 : Dest Increment Address
               0x0: no address increment between transfers
               0x1: increment address between transfers
        -bit 11-12 : data size (source and dest all use this parameter)
               0x0: Byte (8 bits)
               0x1: Half-word (16 bits)
               0x2: Word (32 bits)
               0x3: reserved
        -bit 13-14 : reserved
        -bit 15: reserved
        -bit 16-17 : reserved

    examples for hc32f460
     dma2: dma-controller@40020400 {
         compatible = "xhsc,hc32-dma";
         ...
         dma-requests = <511>;
         status = "disabled";
        };

  For the client part, example for hc32f460 on DMA2 instance
    Tx using channel 0
    Rx using channel 3
    spi1 {
     dmas = <&dma2 0 EVT_SRC_SPI1_SPTI 0x00240>,
            <&dma2 3 EVT_SRC_SPI1_SPRI 0x00480>;
     dma-names = "tx", "rx";
     };
