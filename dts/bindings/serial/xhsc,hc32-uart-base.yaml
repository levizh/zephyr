  interrupts:

  interrupt-names:

  enintsrc:
    required: true
    type: array
    description: |
      Peripheral interrupt number

  single-wire:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the single wire half-duplex communication.
      Using this mode, TX and RX lines are internally connected and
      only TX pin is used afterwards and should be configured.
      RX/TX conflicts must be handled on user side.

  tx-rx-swap:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Swap the TX and RX pins. Used in case of a cross wired connection.

  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  pinctrl-names:
    required: true

  wakeup-line:
    type: int
    description: |
      EXTI line number matching the device wakeup interrupt mask register.
      This property is required on stm32 devices where the wakeup interrupt signal could be
      configured masked at boot (sm32wl55 for instance), preventing the device to wakeup
      the core from stop mode(s).
      Valid range: 0 - 31
